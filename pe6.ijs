NB. The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
NB. 1 2 + 2 2 + ... + 10 2 = 385
NB. The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
NB. ( 1 + 2 + ... + 10) 2 = 55 2 = 3025
NB. Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
NB. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
